## General info
The project was a result of finishing my first HTML5 and CSS course. The source is provided below. 

The scope of the course was to learn basics to be able to create a simple portfolio for a freelance Developer. I have used this idea to create my own page, although the goal is different. I wanted to practice the skills and learn more as I go forward.

I intend to expand this with advanced CSS and JavaScript later on. My motivation is to become a Web Developer or Front-End Developer in the future. 

## Technologies
* HTML 5
* CSS

## Setup
[github pages link](https://nikara4.github.io/WebDevPortfolio/)

## Features
The project is designed for desktop and mobile versions (including iPad and iPad Pro). I have run into a problem with Apple mobile devices when testing (both Iphones and Ipads). The image is widened and pixeled. I intend to fix this soon.

There are no JavaScript features in the project at the moment, but I intend to expand it it the future.

## Status
Project is: in progress. 

I have finished a basic code with the structure and CSS styles. 
The following were added: 
* Profile description,
* My CV section - a subpage consisting of my resume information,
* Working links in menu.

**Update 08/05/2021**: cosmetic changes were made to html and css files in order to improve the design. The resolution 1366px needs changing for desktop wiev.

The following are not completed:
* Projects information, when other projects are finished,
* Backend system to the contact section allowing to send messages.


## Inspiration
This project is based on a final excercise from the course: Web developer od podstaw w 15 dni - [Samuraj Programowania](https://websamuraj.pl/)
I have been also inspired by a few portfolio pages in the Internet: [SebKay](https://sebkay.com/), [Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/) and [Pascal van Gemert](http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/).
