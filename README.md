## General info
The project is a result of finishing my first HTML5 and CSS course. The source is provided below.

The scope of the course is to learn basics of HTML5 and CSS coding to be able to create a simple portfolio for a freelance Developer. I have used this idea to create my own page, although the goal is different. I wanted to practice the skills and learn more as I go forward.

I intend to expand this with advanced CSS and JavaScript later on. My motivation is to become a Web Developer or Front-End Developer in the future.

## Technologies
* HTML 5
* CSS, Sass
* JavaScript

## Setup
[github pages link](https://nikara4.github.io/WebDevPortfolio/)

## Features
The project is designed for desktop and mobile versions (including iPad and iPad Pro). I have run into a problem with Apple mobile devices when testing (both Iphones and Ipads). The image is widened and pixeled. I intend to fix this soon.

## Status
Project is: in progress.

I have finished a basic code with the structure, implemented CSS into Sass code and added JavaScript features to make the page more interactive.

COMPLETED:
* mobile views for new Sass code,
* jQuery and JavaScript for animations, scrolling with menu visible, etc.

The following are not completed:
* Projects information, when other projects are finished,
* Backend system to the contact section allowing to send messages.

## Updates
The following were added:
* Profile description,
* My CV section - a subpage consisting of my resume information,
* Working links in menu.

**Update 08/05/2021**: cosmetic changes were made to html and css files in order to improve the design. The resolution 1366px needs changing for desktop view.

**Update 10/06/2021**: completed Sass code for desktop view and changed menu display.

**Update 28/06/2021**: implementation of JavaScript and jQuery features.

**Update 25/09/2021**: added real projects which I have completed on courses or on my own.

## Inspiration
This project is based on a final exercise from the course: Web developer od podstaw w 15 dni - [Samuraj Programowania](https://websamuraj.pl/)
I have been also inspired by a few portfolio pages in the Internet: [SebKay](https://sebkay.com/), [Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/) and [Pascal van Gemert](http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/).
